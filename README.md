# LV2Lab

# This does not have relevance to the world
* It will probaby disappear 

# The purpose
* Creating the LV2 plugin shell for the interpreters
* Using the LV2 protocol to do what we want it to do
* Testing LV2 plugin theories with renowned equipment

# lv2luajit.cpp
* This is the experimental lv2 plugin to connect the LuaJIT interpreter into the lv2 audio/midi

# lv2load.lua
* This experimental for loading and testing the lv2 plugins with lua

# The GUI is sold seperately
* There is no end to the options you can use for it
* This is only the glue to connect the audio/midi to the interpreters
* You can even use Juce if you connect it to the audio/midi ports


# I am thinning it out now
* I am removing the unncessary kaka
* It is all in other place
